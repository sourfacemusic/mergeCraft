"""``persist-credentials`` must stay false wherever mergeCraft reviews a PR.

actions/checkout persists its token as
``http.https://github.com/.extraheader = AUTHORIZATION: basic ...`` in
``.git/config``. mergeCraft's git layer adds its own ``Authorization: Basic``
(``utils/git_setup.py`` ``git_env_for_token``). ``extraHeader`` is multi-valued
in git, so the second does not replace the first — both go on one request and
GitHub answers ``400 Duplicate header: "Authorization"``. ``checkout_pr`` then
fails, review scope is never established, and every terminal verdict is
rejected with "requires review scope".

Observed on PR #524 (run 33086156079): the agent looped on the unsatisfiable
error, mergeCraft resumed the whole session once, and the run died at
9,395,943 tokens against a 5,000,000 budget having posted no review at all.

The action authenticates from its own ``token:`` input, so nothing needs to be
persisted for it.
